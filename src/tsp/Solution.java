/**
 * 
 * This class models a TSP Solution.
 * 
 * **Internal structure of the class:**
 * 
 * This solution itself is stored in the array #m_cities.
 *
 * #m_cities[i] should be the index of the element at index i in the solution.
 * 
 * The attribute #m_nbCities is the number of cities in the problem.
 * The array #m_cities has size m_nbCities+1 and it should start with the first city for the route and end with the same city.
 * 
 * For example, suppose a problem with 5 customers (hence, the corresponding cities index range from 0 to 4).
 * The following array represents a TSP solution (tour) that visit all customers by index order:
 * 
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * m_cities = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0];
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * 
 * A recommendation is to always have **m_cities[0]=m_cities[m_nbCities]= 0**.
 * 
 * So a complete feasible solution should respect the following rules:
 * 	- m_cities[0]=m_cities[m_nbCities]
 * 	- Apart from the city at indices 0 and #m_nbCities, each customer index should be represented once and only one in #m_cities.
 * 
 * ** Creating, accessing or modifying a solution:**
 * 
 * A Solution object is created for a given TSP problem, represented by an Instance object.
 * Let instance be an object of class Instance, the following code creates a solution for this problem:
 * 
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * Solution mySolution = new Solution(instance);
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * 
 * During its creation, this object is initialized with city 0 at all position. It should be modified to represent a feasible solution.
 * This modification is done by the method {@link #setCityPosition(int city, int position)}, which sets city s at position in the solution.
 * For example, the following code creates a TSP solution that visits all customers in increasing city order:
 * 
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * for(int i=0; i < instance.getNbCities(); i++)
 * {
 * 	mySolution.setVertexPosition(i, i);
 * }
 * mySolution.setVertexPosition(0, instance.getNbCities());
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * 
 * To explore a {@link Solution} object, the city at position can be obtained calling {@link #getCity(int position)}.
 * 
 * The {@link #isFeasible} method allows to check the feasibility of a solution.
 * 
 * To calculate the cost of a solution, you can call {@link #evaluate}.
 * 
 * Note that {@link #evaluate()} recomputes every distance from zero. If you do a slight modification of the solution it is less time consuming to update
 * yourself the cost of the modified solution using the function {@link #setObjectiveValue(long newValue)}.
 *
